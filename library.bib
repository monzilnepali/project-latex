abstract = {Indoor positioning system is a critical part in location-based services.$\backslash$nHighly precise positioning systems can support different mobile applications$\backslash$nin future wireless systems. Positioning systems using existing wireless$\backslash$nnetworks have low deployment costs, but the position error can be$\backslash$nup to several meters. While there are positioning systems proposed$\backslash$nin the literature that have low position error, they require extra$\backslash$nhardware and are therefore costly to deploy. In this paper, we propose$\backslash$nan indoor positioning system based on visible light communications$\backslash$n(VLC). In contrast to existing works on VLC for positioning, our$\backslash$nsystem estimates the location of the receiver in three dimensions$\backslash$neven without: 1) the knowledge of the height of the receiver from$\backslash$nground; and 2) requiring the alignment of the receiver's normal with$\backslash$nthe LED's normal. Our system has low installation cost as it uses$\backslash$nexisting lighting sources as transmitters. Light sensor and accelerometer,$\backslash$nwhich can be found in most smartphones, are used at the receiver's$\backslash$nside. They are used to measure the received light intensity and the$\backslash$norientation of the smartphone. A low-complexity algorithm is then$\backslash$nused to find out the receiver's position. Our system does not require$\backslash$nthe knowledge of the LED transmitters' physical parameters. Experimental$\backslash$nresults show that our system achieves average position errors of$\backslash$nless than 0.25 m.},

abstract = {This paper analyzes the performance of indoor orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) optical wireless communication systems in the presence of light emitting diode (LED) nonlinear distortions. There are several forms of optical OFDM using intensity modulation{\&}{\#}160;[7th Int. Symp. on Communication Systems Networks and Digital Signal Processing (CSNDSP), 2010, pp. 566{\&}{\#}8211;570]. In this paper, DC-biased optical OFDM (DCO-OFDM) and asymmetrically clipped optical OFDM (ACO-OFDM) are considered. ACO-OFDM produces a half-wave symmetry time signal at the output of the OFDM modulator by special assignment of subcarriers, thus allowing signal clipping at the zero level and avoiding the need for DC bias at the expense of data rate reduction. DCO-OFDM assigns data to all possible subcarriers to increase the data rate. However, half-wave symmetry signals cannot be achieved and a high DC bias is needed to convert the bipolar signal to a unipolar signal before modulating the LED intensity. This paper considers a practical LED model and studies the performance of both systems in terms of average electrical OFDM signal power versus bit error ratio in the presence of an additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channel. In addition, DC power consumption and the transmitted optical power for the two systems are compared. The analytical results are validated through Monte Carlo simulations and the obtained results demonstrate close match. It is shown that LED clipping has significant impact on the performance of both systems and an optimum system design should take into account the OFDM signal power, DC-bias point, and LED dynamic range.},

@article{Asadzadeh2011,
abstract = {Asymmetrically clipped optical OFDM (ACO-OFDM) is compatible with optical intensity modulation and is well suited to bandlimited optical wireless channels. By carefully locating data on odd subcarriers and clipping the resulting time signal, ACO-OFDM guarantees non-negative output amplitudes and clipping noise orthogonal to the information. However, in the conventional receiver, clipping noise is ignored in detection and data are extracted from odd subcarriers only. In this paper, a new receiver design for ACO-OFDM is proposed which exploits the structure of the clipping noise to improve the optical power efficiency. By observing the anti-symmetry of time domain samples, a simple pairwise maximum likelihood detector is developed and is used to fix half of the received samples to zero. Simulation results show that employing the proposed detector design leads to 1.3 dB optical gain at a BER of 10{\textless}sup{\textgreater}{\&}{\#}x2212;5{\textless}/sup{\textgreater}.},
